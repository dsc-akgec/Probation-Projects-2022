                <ul>
                   <li>  1 pound ground lean (7% fat) beef</li>
                   <li>1 large egg</li>

                   <li>1 or 2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced</li>
                   <li>About 1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                   <li>About 1/4 teaspoon peppe</li>
                   <li>4 hamburger buns (4 in. wide), split</li>
                   <li>About 1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
                   <li>About 1/4 cup ketchup</li>
                   <li>About 1/4 cup ketchup</li>
                   <li>4 iceberg lettuce leaves, rinsed and crisped</li>
                   <li>1 firm-ripe tomato, cored and thinly sliced</li>
                   <li>4 thin slices red onion</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>How to make Burger üçî</h4>
                   <p> In a bowl, mix ground beef, egg, onion, bread crumbs, Worcestershire, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/5 teaspoon pepper until well blended. Divide mixture into four equal portions and shape each into a patty about 4 inches wide.
                   Lay burgers on an oiled barbecue grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2 to 3 seconds); close lid on gas grill. Cook burgers, turning once, until browned on both sides and no longer pink inside (cut to test), 7 to 8 minutes total. Remove from grill.
                   Lay buns, cut side down, on grill and cook until lightly toasted, 30 seconds to 1 minute.
                Spread mayonnaise and ketchup on bun bottoms. Add lettuce, tomato, burger, onion, and salt and pepper to taste. Set bun tops in place.</p>

                <center><h1>Paneer Tikka</h1></center>
                <center><p class="time">35 minutes to make</p></center>
                <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                <ul>
                   <li>broccoli</li>
                   <li>Paneer (Indian cottage cheese)</li>
                   <li>baby corn</li>
                   <li>tomatoes</li>
                   <li>cauliflower</li>
                   <li>Marinade</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>How to make Paneer Tikka</h4>
                   <p>Barbecue: You can also cook the paneer tikka on barbecue grill.
                    Grilling in the oven: In the oven grill for 15 to 20 minutes at 230 or 240 degree celsius with only the top heating element on. Basically here we are broiling the dish.
                    Marination Time: It is best to marinate the paneer cubes for 2 hours or more. You can also keep the marinated paneer overnight in the fridge. Since I made the paneer tikka for dinner, I marinated the paneer and veggies for 2 hours in the refrigerator. The longer it marinates, the better flavors get infused into the paneer and veggies.
                    Vegetables: The veggies used can be of your choice. In the step by step photos, I have used onions and green bell pepper (capsicum). In the video I have used red, yellow and green bell pepper with onions. You can use baby corn, mushrooms, cauliflower, tomatoes, broccoli etc. For cauliflower blanch them before marinating.
                    Adding Oil: While grilling or baking, the paneer cubes and veggies can become dry. Oil is added to paneer and veggie mixture to prevent this from happening. The paneer cubes and veggies are also brushed with some oil to avoid them from becoming dry.
                    Overcooking: Don‚Äôt overcook the paneer as they then become rubbery, dry and hard. The paneer should be soft, well cooked but also succulent.
                    Marinade: The leftover marinade can be applied or brushed on the paneer tikka before grilling them. If you are making paneer tikka masala gravy, you can use the extra marinade in the gravy.
                    Vegan Options: Use tofu, seitan or tempeh in place of paneer. Use a vegan yogurt like almond or cashew yogurt in place of dairy yogurt.</p>

                <center><h1>Hot Coffee ‚òï</h1></center>
                <center><p class="time">15 minutes to make</p></center>
                <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                <ul>
                   <li>Coffee powder</li>
                   <li>Water</li>
                   <li>Milk</li>
                   <li>Sugar</li>

                </ul>
                <h4>How to make Hot Coffee ‚òï</h4>
                   <p>Brew coffee using your favorite method. While the coffee is brewing, pour 12 ounces of milk into the glass jar. Screw on the lid.
                    Shake the jar as hard as you can until the milk is frothy and has roughly doubled in volume, 30 to 60 seconds. Remove the lid from the jar and microwave the jar uncovered for 30 seconds on high. The foam will rise to the top of the milk (and nearly double in volume) while the heat from the microwave will help to stabilize it.
                    Remove from the heat and stir in the hot coffee. Pour into mugs.

                <center><h1>Pasta</h1></center>
                <center><p class="time">30 minutes to make</p></center>
                <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                <ul>
                   <li>2 red chilli</li>
                   <li>2 pinches powdered black pepper</li>
                   <li>salt as required</li>
                   <li>2 teaspoon basil</li>
                   <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
                   <li>225 gm pasta penne</li>
                   <li>450 gm roma tomato</li>
                   <li>1/2 teaspoon chilli flakes</li>
                   <li>3 cup water</li>
                   <li>Boiling pasta</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>How to make Pasta</h4>
                   <p>Heat oil in a pan over medium flame and add minced garlic along with chopped red chilli and red chilli flakes. Stir and saute for 2 minutes. Take another pan, pour the water and bring it to a boil. Then, add pasta to the boiling water along with some salt and 1/2 tbsp oil. Cook the pasta for a few minutes. When it is cooked through, drain the extra water and transfer the pasta to another bowl.
                    Now, heat the olive oil and add the peeled (or pureed) tomatoes, basil and parsley to the pan. Mix all the ingredients well and let it simmer for 10 minutes until the sauce starts to thicken. When the sauce starts gaining consistency, put off the burner and add salt and black pepper powder to the sauce. Keep the sauce warm. Add the pasta over the warm sauce and toss carefully so that each piece is coated with the sauce.
                    Cook for 2-3 minutes more and then serve the Red Sauce Pasta immediately. To make it more aromatic, you can dry roast a few basil leaves, crush them with some chilli flakes, oregano and add it to the dish. This herb fusion will make your pasta even more delectable. Serve it with garlic bread and relish this delicious pasta.</p>
